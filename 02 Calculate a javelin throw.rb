# In this challenge, youâ€™ll calculate a trajectory.
# Create a Ruby function that takes two parameters. 
# The first parameter will be the initial speed of the javelin in meters per second. 
# The second parameter will be the angle the javelin was thrown in degrees.

# The function should return the maximum height that the javelin will reach and the maximum range of the javelin as a string.
# Results should be rounded to the nearest whole number. 
# To help with your calculations, gravitational acceleration is 9.81 meters per second.
